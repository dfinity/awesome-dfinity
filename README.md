## Hackathon projects

The DFINITY Tungsten Hackathon channeled the energy and excitement of DFINITY's internal engineers over two days in June 2020 to build applications for the Internet Computer.

The following represent a few of the applications that teams developed over the two-day period:

- [Magnify](https://github.com/Dfinity-Bjoern/Magnify) - A secure video conferencing application using WebRTC.

- [Dual](https://github.com/egeyar/wochonecha/) - A social app for creating, completing, and tracking various challenges.

- [Bookworm](https://github.com/rstout/bookworm) - An open publishing application inspired by China Literature.

- [Shield](https://github.com/crusso/shield) - An app connecting at-risk people with nearby volunteers.

- [Hero](https://github.com/stanleygjones/hackathon) - A random "killer app" generator inspired by the Wu-Tang Name Generator.
