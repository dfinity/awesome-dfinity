## Hackathon projects

The DFINITY Tungsten Hackathon channeled the energy and excitement of DFINITY's internal engineers over two days in June 2020 to build applications for the Internet Computer.

The following represent a few of the applications that teams developed over the two-day period:

- [Magnify](https://github.com/Dfinity-Bjoern/Magnify) - A secure video conferencing application using WebRTC.

- [Dual](https://github.com/egeyar/wochonecha/) - A social app for creating, completing, and tracking various challenges.

- [Bookworm](https://github.com/rstout/bookworm) - An open publishing application inspired by China Literature.

- [Shield](https://github.com/crusso/shield) - An app connecting at-risk people with nearby volunteers.

- [Hero](https://github.com/stanleygjones/hackathon) - A random "killer app" generator inspired by the Wu-Tang Name Generator.

## Example apps from the DFINITY team

- [IC Game Terminal](https://github.com/matthewhammer/ic-game-terminal) - Keyboard input (âŒ¨) and graphical output (ðŸ“º) for programs on the Internet Computer.

- [Journey](https://github.com/hansl/journey) - An open blog engine written for the Internet Computer.

- [Reversi](https://github.com/ninegua/reversi) - A multiplayer Reversi Game on Internet Computer.

- [Superheroes](https://github.com/enzoh/superheroes) - A simple example that demonstrates how to build a CRUD application on the Internet Computer using Motoko and React.
